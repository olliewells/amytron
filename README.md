<h1>Amytron â€“ Front-end framework</h1>
<p>A front-end framework, intended for my own / internal use and quick prototyping. It is based on BEM / OOCSS / DRY coding principals and uses SCSS, the Foundation 5 grid system and utilises mixins from Bourbon and Compass.</p>
<p>This is very much a work-in-progress and something which will be continually added to.</p>
